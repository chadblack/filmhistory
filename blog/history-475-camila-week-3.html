<p>A story of love and passion comes to the big screen in the form of <em>Camilla. </em>This story was touching and&nbsp;moving for the audience by combining a passionate and forbidden love story with actual tragic and dirty history of Argentina in the late nineteenth century. <br /><br />Camilla O&#8217;Gorman, is a vibrant and beautiful young woman. It is important to note, when analyzing this film, that she is a strong and outspoken young woman. At only 20 she is going against society by reading scandalous novels, and talking back to her father, all of this before she elopes with the town priest. In her relationship with Lasilado, she is the dominate one, she is the leader. An ironic role switch between the two considering he was her confessor when first introduced in the film. This story is important because it depicts Camilla as a strong woman, in a very patriarchal and masculine society. This is the most important thing in the film for me. Because the director, also a woman, decided to highlight the character of Camilla this way, she is showing that those believed to be weak and controllable, can rise up, like Camilla. And eventually the people of Argentina took hold of their situation, just like Camilla did. <br /><br />The story of Camilla is based on a true story. Facts of her story that are important include: being the daughter of a wealthy socialite, being born into privilege, and being engaged to a wealthy suitor prior to her indiscretions with the priest. These are important, because this&nbsp;woman, is depicted, and single handily ruining the reputation of her once great family. Her father, in the film, believes she is just like her Grandmother, who also tainted the name of O&#8217;Gorman. If this is true, the both the grandfather, and the father, failed to &#8216;control&#8217; the women in their household, and these women&#8217;s actions were a direct &#8216;slap-in-the-face&#8217; to the leaders of the family. Please note that in a patriarchal society, and Hart&#8217;s article depicts Argentina as being very patriarchal and masculine, actions such as this by lowly women is a huge disgrace. This sheds some light on the the actions of Camilla&#8217;s father in condoning her death in the film. <br /><br />Overall the very interesting history of Argentina, and the Dirty War, was overshadowed by this love story in the film. Although and interesting story, the historical aspect is just hidden by the dynamic characters and their plot. I do believe that this is an interesting way to depict this history, using events of Argentinian history to help the plot move along, such as the book seller&#8217;s murder and the red pins worn by the characters, but more was left unsaid than said in this film I believe. Although the audience can understand that the leader/governor was a very overbearing and tyrannical ruler from just the minimum amount he is presented in Camilla.<br /><br /><em>Camilla </em>incorporated a very interesting and sad love story with a very real and sad history of Argentina. I enjoyed the plot and the story and the characters, and would have enjoyed some more historical facts along with that.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4958459512668771778-5040798351376009211?l=keanito.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
