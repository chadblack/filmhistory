<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #333333; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;"><b>&#8220;Love of humanity&#8230; of justice and truth. A real revolutionary goes where he is needed.&#8221;</b></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Building on what we have learned of Che Guevara through the Motorcycle Diaries this movie continued the perspective of Che as a protectorate of the indigenous people. That the people at the bottom were the ones who he felt had no voice whatsoever and that he needed to speak out for them. This is spoken about in his “Message to the Tricontinental” when he is speaking on the Korean War. He talks about how the United States was experimenting with the Korean people different weapons of war. He specifically uses the language cannon fodder, which evokes a certain ethos. He then continues to devolve into a discussion about the Vietnam War. He talks about how the Vietnam people are actually just a puppet in the role between imperialistic countries. What are even more interesting about this article are Che’s feelings about America. This contrasting emotion towards the United States can be seen in this article and in the movie. He believes President Johnson’s “Great Society” reforms will never actually succeed. He also believes that these weak trials are making Vietnam worse. This is very revealing about Che because one would think he would appreciate Johnson’s reforms but he does not. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Che also talks about in this speech the United State’s aggression to keep the status quo of it’s own power in the world. He emphasizes what the United States did in Panama. Which he also does in the movie during the speech at the United Nations. Che’s statements on neocolonialism are very interesting in that they keep the economic status the same as it was before. One of the remarkable things that stand out about Che in all of his works is his language. One example is from this article when he uses the words fiefs to describe the colonial holdings of these imperialistic countries. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>“Violence is not the monopoly of the exploiters and as such the exploited can use it too and, moreover, ought to use it when the moment arrives.”</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">One of the most important parts of this movie was showing how guerilla warfare was developed in the eyes of Che Guevara. He made many distinctions during the movie about what it was and what it was not. It was not a group that wrecked havoc on the indigenous countryside. He believed that these were the people they were fighting to liberate not to destroy. These sentiments were backed up through the article “Guerilla Warfare: A Method.” He talks about what it means to do this kind of warfare. The main part is that it is a means to an end. This is a misnomer of Che Guevara as seen through the interviews with the Americans throughout the movie. He wants to accomplish a finished product through his idea of warfare. He believes in the strength of the people and that through guerilla warfare they earn back the right to govern their country. He believes most importantly in two central factors he feels are necessary. One that there has a to be a central rural basis. This is shown in the movie by their very well constructed camps. The other is the importance of education and the guerilla troops them being educated. He makes sure that the guerilla troops are taught well in these schools. He also does not believe that an urban warfare can truly work. This is shown in the movie when Castro tries to make a deal with the urban fighters and Che does not like it. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>“A country that can’t read and write is easy to deceive.”</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">One of the most important concepts to know about Che Guevara was that he wanted to spread what had occurred in Cuba throughout South America. He felt from an early age that “this America” as he called it deserved its time. This is what he says in the end. That he wants to take it throughout Southern and Central America. As indicated by the documents about the fall of Che Guevara he did not stay in Cuba for this exact reason. He felt that his real job of creating and keeping alive the revolution was done and that he was better elsewhere. In Che’s own document he does comment that the United States wants to prevent another Cuba from happening, which would lead one to believe that he knew the United States, did not approve of what he was doing. It would also show that he knew that his life might be in danger from United States forces because of his continued revolutionary sentiment.&nbsp;</div><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-8007111872819638580?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
