          Your core assignment this semester will be to produce an exhaustive wiki on one film and the historical issues related to that film. This project is a group project, and because the class is so big the list of films will be expanded to provide enough films for groups of 5 people. Each group is responsible for for planning, researching, and writing an exhaustive wiki-based website on a film and its historical themes. I hope for real creativity, but also for fidelity to good citation practices. Remember that just because this is a web-based project does not mean that you can become lax on issues of citation. Plagiarism will be treated ruthlessly. Each group must start with a wiki page covering the specifics of the film itself, and develop from there.  

What will this project look like? That depends on you and your group mates. I will provide the following list of deadlines:  
1. Form groups and assign films. <strong>January 26.</strong> You will form yourselves into groups of five students each, and at the start of class on week three I'll randomly assign those groups a film.  
2. Project plan. <strong>March 9.</strong> Groups must produce a project plan that identifies the historical themes that will be developed. The plan must include a bibliography of history books, articles, and <strong>scholarly</strong> websites that will form the basis for the research aspect of this project. These projects are in lieu of term papers, and the total workload needs to be the same as if each of you were researching and writing a 15-20 page research paper. The plan should also include the "names" of pages your group is going to construct for the project.  
3.  Construct the wiki. <strong>May 4.</strong> In realizing your project, I want you to think and construct creatively, utilizing both traditional historical research skills and whatever multimedia forms that you're comfortable. Risk taking will be rewarded. The sandbox for producing this work is the class wiki. Edits to your wiki pages will be accepted until 5pm on May 4. At whatever state the projects are in at that point is what will be graded.  

What type of information can you include?  
<ul>
Voice over commentary on clips of the film.  

Historical essays.  

Film criticism.  

Digital storytelling.  

Wikipedia-style articles.  

All of the above.  

What ever else you can think up!  
</ul>

Everyone in the group will receive the same grade. In order to ensure equal labor, any group may vote to remove one of its group members after a meeting with me. However, that member cannot be replaced. If an individual is voted off the island, so to speak, they must do a project on an alternative film on their own, to the same level of sophistication as the group. The group that loses someone will still need to do the labor of five as well.
